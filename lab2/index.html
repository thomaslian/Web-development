    <p>Hi, everybody! This is <strong>my <del>1 <sup>st</sup></del> <ins>2 <sup>nd</sup></ins> site.</strong></p>

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am the youngest child of my house. Due to my condition, I have learned to use my wit and intellect
        to overcome the prejudice I have to face all the time.</p>
    <p>I have had a very tough life. My father despites me. Many people tried to murder me during my whole life.
        Among them, my sister, after being falsely accused of poisoning my nephew. I was lucky then,
        and my brother saved me. Since then, I have lived in exile and now I serve the enemy of my house.</p>
    <p>You may remember what I said at my trial, when I was falsely accused of killing my nephew, the King:
        "I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime: I'm guilty of being a dwarf!"</p>
    <p><strong>Who am I?</strong></p>
