                            Hailing from the Branch Worlds’ Planet X, Groot is part of a species called Groot,
                            so his name is also the title of his taxonomic classification. From the time he was a
                            sapling,
                            Groot was destined to protect the rights of the downtrodden.
                            He campaigned for the Undergrowth, anthropomorphic animals and fungi who helped maintain
                            Planet

                            ecosystem by performing menial tasks. Groot’s noble campaign drew the rancor of the other
                            Groots
                            and he ended up leaving his home world.

                        Avengers as the size-changing hero Ant-Man. Desperate to provide for his family, but unable to

                        crime in an
                        effort to save his daughter’s life.
