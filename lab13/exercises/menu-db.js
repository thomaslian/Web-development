//This array contains the list of all the categories in which the ice creams are divided
//notice that all the names are lowercase. If you want to display them into your page, you can use 
//CSS rules to capitalize or uppercase...
var categories = [
    "ice creams",
    "sundaes",
    "mousses",
    "smoothies"
];

//The iceCreams variable contain a lists indexed by the category name. 
//In other words, this is a list of lists.
//E.g. To get the first ice cream from the "plain ice cream" category you will do:
//   iceCreams["plain ice cream"][0]
var iceCreams = [];

//Ice creams under "ice cream" category
//For example, if you want to get the name of the first ice cream you can use the following syntax:
//  iceCreams["ice creams"][0].name
//  The previous expression will return "Bloody hell"
/*
 NOTE: if you already know javascript or you revisit this code in the future, 
 you will realise that "associative arrays" do not exist in js and, 
 therefore, iceCreams.lenght will return 0. For that reason I have created 2 different arrays,
 one with the categoryes and this one.
 Another way of looping all the categories of the "iceCreams" list is using the properties 
 of the list as a "key"

  for (var cat in iceCreams) {
   if (iceCreams.hasOwnProperty(key))
     console.log(iceCreams[key]);
  }

 or, in modern browsers, you can also use the Object.keys function like this:

  Object.keys(iceCreams).forEach(function(key, index) {
   console.log(index);
   console.log(key);
   console.log(this[key]);
  }, iceCreams);
