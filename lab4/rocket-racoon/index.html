            Don’t be fooled by his standoffish and morally ambiguous bravado, this tactical genius will put his hide on
            the line for
            his friends and the galaxy they defend.

            A native of the Keystone Quadrant, Rocket Raccoon began his life as a protector of an unidentified humanoid
            race known as
            the Loonies. They came to the planet hundreds of years prior when psychiatrists, searching for a place to
            house and
            study their criminally insane away from the contempt of everyday society, founded an asylum on planet
            Halfworld.
            Wanting their new environment to be as friendly as possible, the founders brought furry creatures to
            comfort their
            patients while they built robots to help care for them. For years, the psychiatrists studied patients on
            Halfworld
            before returning home and leaving their patients under the sole care of the remaining robots. As time
            passed the
            robots became sentient and longed to leave Halfworld. They genetically engineered the Earth-like animals,
            creating
            humanized caretakers to function in their stead, and withdrew to build a ship capable of breaking through
            the force
            field surrounding the planet—another security measure left behind by the founders.
