I have done coursework 3 and 4. In coursework 4 i choose to make it not possible to make a reservation between 22:00 and 10:00. It is also not
possible to make a reservation in the past (date). In the "our ice cream" page it is possible to sort by name, price and description for each category.

I had a hard time finding horror themed ice cream pictures that were not copyrighted. So i choose to use normal ice cream photos for the front page instead.
All pictures are free for personal and commercial use.
Here are the links for the pictures:
