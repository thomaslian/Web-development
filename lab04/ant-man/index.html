            From the Big House to the Ant Farm
        </p>

        <p>
            Desperate to provide for his family, but unable to make ends meet, electronics genius Scott Lang turned to
            burglary and inadvertently
            won himself a prison sentence. After being released early for good behavior, he knuckled down to raise his
            daughter
            Cassie, though soon discovered nothing had changed with his luck and fortunes. When Cassie fell ill from a
            devastating
            heart ailment and her surgeon was abducted by a mysterious wealthy man, Lang reluctantly returned to his
            life
            of
            crime in an effort to save his daughter’s life.
        </p>

        <p>
            Assuming scientist Hank Pym’s home might offer expensive equipment to pawn for cash, Lang broke in, but
            discovered something
            far more valuable—unbeknownst to him, he was staring his future in the face. He left the home with Pym’s
            old
            Ant-Man
            gear and uniform, left over from the scientist’s early days as a Super Hero with the Avengers, and set out
            to
            use
            it to rescue Cassie’s surgeon.
